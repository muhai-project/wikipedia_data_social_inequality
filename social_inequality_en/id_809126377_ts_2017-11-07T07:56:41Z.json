It is the differentiation preference of access of social goods in the society brought about by power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and class. The social rights include labor market, the source of income, health care, and freedom of speech, education, political representation, and participation.<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Robert H.|title=The Piketty phenomenon and the future of inequality|journal=Real World Economics Review|date=2014|issue=69-7|pages=2–17|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue69/Wade69.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2017}}<\\/ref> Social inequality  linked to [[Economic inequality]], usually described on the basis of the [[income inequality|unequal distribution of income]] or [[wealth]], is a frequently studied type of social inequality. Though the disciplines of [[economics]] and [[sociology]] generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in [[researching]] this inequality. However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to [[social status]]. Norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of [[rights]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[Power (social and political)|social power]], access to [[public goods]] such as [[education]] or the [[judiciary|judicial system]], adequate [[Housing inequality|housing]], [[transportation]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[financial services]] such as [[banking]] and other social [[Good (economics)|good]]s and services.\\n\\nMany societies worldwide claim to be [[Meritocracy|meritocracies]]—ithat is, that their societies exclusively distribute resources on the basis of merit.

In [[tribal]] societies, for example, a tribal head or chieftain may hold some privileges, use some tools, or wear marks of office to which others do not have access, but the daily life of the chieftain is very much like the daily life of any other tribal member. [[Anthropologist]]s identify such highly egalitarian cultures as \\\"[[kinship]]-oriented\\\", which appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with materially oriented cultures in which status and wealth are prized and competition and conflict are common.

People with special skills were not viewed as superior compared to the rest. The leaders do not have the power they only have influence. The norms and the beliefs the egalitarian society holds are for sharing equally and equal participation. Simply there are no classes. Ranked society mostly is agricultural communities who hierarchically grouped from the chief who is viewed to have a status in the society. In this society, people are clustered regarding status and prestige and not by access to power and resources. The chief is the most influential person followed by his family and relative, and those further related to him are less ranked. Stratified society is societies which horizontally ranked into the upper class, middle class, and lower class. The classification is regarding wealth, power, and prestige. The upper class are mostly the leaders and are the most influential in the society. It's possible for a person in the society to move from one stratum to the other. The social status is also hereditable from one generation to the next.<ref name=\\\":0\\\" />\\n\\nThere are five systems/types of social inequality which include wealth inequality, treatment and responsibility inequality, political inequality, life inequality, and membership inequality. Political inequality is the difference brought about by the ability to access federal resources which therefore have no civic equality. In treatment and responsibility difference some people are more benefited and can quickly receive more privileged than others. In working stations, some are given more responsibilities and hence better compensations and more benefits than the rest even when equally qualified. Membership inequality this is the number of members in a family, nation or of faith. Life inequality is brought about by the disparity of opportunities if presented they improves a person life quality. Finally, the income and wealth inequality is the disparity due to what an individual can earn on a daily basis contributing to their total revenue either monthly or yearly.<ref name=\\\":1\\\" />\\n\\nThe major examples of social inequality include income gap, gender inequality,  health care, and social class. The pay differential for white people their earnings are higher compared to the blacks. In health care, some individuals receive better and more professional care compared to others. They are also expected to pay more for these services. Social class differential comes evident during the public gathering where upper-class people given the best places to seat, the hospitality they receive and the first priorities they receive.<ref name=\\\":1\\\" />\\n\\nStatus in society is of two types which are [[Ascribed status|ascribed characteristics]] and [[achieved status|achieved characteristics]]. Ascribed characteristics are those present at birth or assigned by others and over which an individual has little or no control. Examples include sex, skin colour, eye shape, place of birth, sexuality, gender identity, parentage and social status of parents. Achieved characteristics are those which we earn or choose; examples include level of education, marital status, leadership status and other measures of [[Meritocracy|merit]]. In most societies, an individual's social status is a combination of ascribed and achieved factors. In some societies, however, only ascribed statuses are considered in determining one's social status and there exists little to no [[social mobility]] and, therefore, few paths to more social equality.<ref name=\\\"Sernau13\\\">{{cite book|title=Social Inequality in a Global Age (4th edition)|publisher=Sage|year=2013|isbn=978-1452205403|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|author=Sernau, Scott}}<\\/ref> This type of social inequality is generally referred to as [[caste|caste inequality]].\\n\\nOne's social location in a society's overall structure of [[social stratification]] affects and is affected by almost every aspect of social life and one's [[life chances]].<ref name=\\\"Neckerman\\\">{{cite journal | title=Inequality: Causes and Consequences |author1=Neckerman, Kathryn M.  |author2=Florencia Torche  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Annual Review of Sociology | year=2007 | volume=33 | pages=335–357 | doi=10.2307/29737766 | jstor=29737766}}<\\/ref> The single best [[Dependent and independent variables|predictor]] of an individual's future social status is the social status into which they were born.

At the other end of the continuum, collectivists place little to no trust in \\\"free market\\\" economic systems, noting widespread lack of access among specific groups or classes of individuals to the costs of entry to the market. Widespread inequalities often lead to [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and dissatisfaction with the current social order. Such ideologies include [[Fabian society|Fabianism]], [[socialism]], and [[Marxism]] or [[communism]].

Classic Chinese society in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang dynasties]], for example, while highly organized into tight hierarchies of [[horizontal inequality]] with a distinct power elite also had many elements of free trade among its various regions and subcultures.<ref>Ebrey, Patricia Buckley Anne Walthall, James Palais.

There is a change in literacy, [[income distribution]], education and health status. The movement can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is the upward or downward movement along social strata which occurs due to change of jobs or marriage. Horizontal movement along levels that are equally ranked. Intra-generational mobility is a social status change in a generation (single lifetime). For example, a person moves from a junior staff in an organization to the [[senior management]]. The absolute management movement is where a person gains better social status than their parents, and this can be due to improved security, economic development, and better education system.  Relative mobility is where some individual are expected to have higher social ranks than their parents.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Climbing Mount Laurel: The struggle for affordable housing and social mobility in an American suburb|last=Massey, D.

It is often used as synonymous with social class, a set of hierarchical social categories that indicate an individual's or household's relative position in a stratified matrix of social relationships. Social class is delineated by a number of variables, some of which change across time and place. For [[Karl Marx]], there exist two major social classes with significant inequality between the two. The two are delineated by their relationship to the [[means of production]] in a given society. Those two classes are defined as the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labour to the owners of the means of production. In capitalistic societies, the two classifications represent the opposing social interests of its members, capital gain for the capitalists and good wages for the labourers, creating [[social conflict]].\\n\\n[[Max Weber]] uses social classes to examine wealth and status. For him, social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges. It may explain social reproduction, the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well. Such inequalities include differences in income, wealth, access to education, pension levels, social status, socioeconomic safety-net.<ref>Stiglitz, Joseph. 2012. The Price of Inequality.

Working class are those people in blue-collar jobs and usually, affects the economic level of a nation. The Middle classes are those who rely mostly on wives' employment and depends on credits from the bank and medical coverage.

Ethnicity is the privilege one enjoys for belonging to a particular ethnic group. Even though race has no biological connection, it has become a socially constructed category capable of restricting or enabling social status.\\n\\nRacial inequality can also result in diminished opportunities for members of [[marginalized]] groups, which in turn can lead to [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]] and political marginalization.

It is also known as [[ageism]]: the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age. It is a set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, and values used to justify age-based prejudice, discrimination, and subordination.<ref>Kirkpatrick, George R.; Katsiaficas, George N.; Kirkpatrick, Robert George; Mary Lou Emery (1987).

Retrieved 28 January 2011.<\\/ref> One form of ageism is [[adultism]], which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age.<ref>Lauter And Howe (1971) Conspiracy of the Young. Meridian Press.<\\/ref> An example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment, restaurant, or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all. While some people may benefit or enjoy these practices, some find them offensive and discriminatory. Discrimination against those under the age of 40 however is not illegal under the current U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).<ref>http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm<\\/ref>\\n\\nAs implied in the definitions above, treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination. Virtually every society has [[Age stratification|age-stratification]], meaning that the age structure in a society changes as people begin to live longer and the [[Population ageing|population becomes older]]. In most cultures, there are different social role expectations for people of different ages to perform. Every society manages people's ageing by allocating certain roles for different age groups. Age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less resources. Scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities. For instance, because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens, modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle-aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired (especially those already disadvantaged by income/wealth inequality).<ref name=\\\"Sargeant11\\\">{{cite book | title=Age Discrimination and Diversity Multiple Discrimination from an Age Perspective | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Sargeant, Malcolm (ed.) | year=2011 | isbn=978-1107003774}}<\\/ref>\\n\\nIn modern, technologically advanced societies, there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged. However, more recently, in the United States the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged. For example, [[Poverty in the United States|poverty levels in the U.S.]] have been decreasing among people aged 65 and older since the early 1970s whereas the number children under 18 in poverty has steadily risen.<ref name=\\\"Sargeant11\\\"/> Sometimes, the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives, younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere. The larger contributor to this, however is the increase in the number of people over 65 receiving [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits in the U.S.\\n\\nWhen we compare income distribution among youth across the globe, we find that about half (48.5 percent) of the world's young people are confined to the bottom two income brackets as of 2007. This means that, out of the three billion persons under the age of 24 in the world as of 2007, approximately 1.5 billion were living in situations in which they and their families had access to just nine percent of global income. Moving up the income distribution ladder, children and youth do not fare much better: more than two-thirds of the world's youth have access to less than 20 percent of global wealth, with 86 percent of all young people living on about one-third of world income. For the just over 400 million youth who are fortunate enough to rank among families or situations at the top of the income distribution, however, opportunities improve greatly with more than 60 percent of global income within their reach.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/index_58230.html | title=Global inequality:  Beyond the bottom billion | publisher=UNICEF | work=UNICEF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY WORKING PAPER | date=April 2011 | accessdate=9 July 2014 |author1=Ortiz, Isabel  |author2=Matthew Cummins |lastauthoramp=yes }}<\\/ref>\\n\\nAlthough this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination, in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment. Indeed, non-participation in the labour force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age. On the one hand, the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce: At the same time, old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige. Old age may benefit one in such positions, but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotyping of old people. On the other hand, young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs, because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education. Typically, once they enter the labour force or take a part-time job while in school, they start at entry level positions with low level wages. Furthermore, because of their lack of prior work experience, they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs, where they can be taken advantage of by their employers. As a result, many older people have to face obstacles in their lives.\\n\\n===Inequalities in health===\\n{{further information|Health equity|Inequality in disease|Social determinants of health in poverty|Diseases of poverty}}\\nHealth inequalities can be defined as differences in health status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=United Nations Health Impact Assessment: Glossary of Terms Used|url=http://www.who.int/hia/about/glos/en/index1.html|accessdate=10 April 2013}}<\\/ref>\\n\\n====Health care====\\nHealth inequalities are in many cases related to access to health care. In [[industrialized nations]], health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a [[universal health care]] system, such as the United States. Because the US health care system is heavily privatized, access to health care is dependent upon one's [[economic capital]]; Health care is not a right, it is a commodity that can be purchased through private insurance companies (or that is sometimes provided through an employer). The way health care is organized in the U.S. contributes to health inequalities based on gender, [[socioeconomic status]] and race/ethnicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric R.|author2=Perry, Brea L. |title=Medical Sociology and Health Services Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Policy Challenges|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2010|pages=107–119}}<\\/ref> As Wright and Perry assert, \\\"social status differences in health care are a primary mechanism of health inequalities\\\".

Citizens are seen as consumers who have a 'choice' to buy the best health care they can afford; in alignment with neoliberal ideology, this puts the burden on the individual rather than the government or the community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|title=The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care, and Retirement - and How You Can Fight Back|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}<\\/ref>\\n\\nIn countries that have a universal health care system, health inequalities have been reduced. In Canada, for example, equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. People don't have to worry about how they will pay health care, or rely on emergency rooms for care, since health care is provided for the entire population. However, inequality issues still remain. For example, not everyone has the same level of access to services.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Karen R.|title=Health and Health Care in Essentials of Contemporary Sociology|year=1994|publisher=Copp Clark Longman|location=Toronto|page=275}}<\\/ref> Inequalities in health are not, however, only related to access to health care. Even if everyone had the same level of access, inequalities may still remain. This is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them. While Medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services, which improved the health of low status people, inequities in health are still prevalent in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=K.R.|title=The Inverse Care Law in Canada: Differential Access Under Universal Free Health Insurance|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=Toronto|pages=118–134}}<\\/ref> This may be due to the state of the current social system, which bear other types of inequalities such as economic, racial and gender inequality.\\n\\nA lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world, where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at. Health equity is needed in order to live a healthier and more sufficient life within society. Inequalities in health lead to substantial effects, that is burdensome or the entire society. Inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care. Health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal. For example, in Indonesia in 1990, only 12% of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20% of households, while the wealthiest 20% consumed 29% of the government subsidy in the health sector.<ref>{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}<\\/ref> Access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well, as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it. A study by Makinen et al. (2000) found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at, there was an upward trend by [[Quantile|quintile]] in health care use for those reporting illness. Wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000000100006&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt | title=Inequalities in Health Care Use and Expenditures: Empirical Data from Eight Developing Countries and Countries in Transition | publisher=Bulletin of the World Health Organization 38:1 | date=January 2000 | last=Mankinen, M.| doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000000100006|display-authors=etal}}<\\/ref>\\n\\n====Food====\\nThere has been considerable research in recent years regarding a phenomenon known as [[food desert]]s, in which low access to fresh, healthy food in a neighborhood leads to poor consumer choices and options regarding diet.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Defines Food Deserts|url=http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts|website=American Nutrition Association|publisher=American Nutrition Association|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}<\\/ref> It is widely thought that food deserts are significant contributors to the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States and many other countries.\\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eisenhauer|first1=Elizabeth|title=In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition|journal=GeoJournal|date=2001|volume=53|issue=2|pages=125–133|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015772503007}}<\\/ref> This may have significant impacts on the local level as well as in broader contexts, such as in Greece, where the childhood obesity rate has skyrocketed in recent years heavily as a result of the rampant poverty and the resultant lack of access to fresh foods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manios, Y., Vlachopapadopoulou, E., Moschonis, G., Karachaliou, F., Psaltopoulou, T., Koutsouki, D., . . .

Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets.<ref name=\\\"Davtyan\\\" /> Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these fiscal conditions and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth in the case of the UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.<ref name=\\\"Davtyan\\\" />\\n\\nFollowing the results of Alesina and Rodrick (1994), Bourguignon (2004), and Birdsall (2005) show that developing countries with high inequality tend to grow more slowly,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth |author1=Alesina, A.  |author2=D.

For 131 countries for which they could estimate the change in Gini index values between 1990 and 2008, they find that those countries that increased levels of inequality experienced slower annual per capita GDP growth over the same time period. Noting a lack of data for national wealth, they build an index using ''[[Forbes]]'' list of billionaires by country normalized by GDP and validated through correlation with a Gini coefficient for wealth and the share of wealth going to the top decile. They find that many countries generating low rates of economic growth are also characterized by a high level of wealth inequality with wealth concentration among a class of entrenched elites. They conclude that extreme inequality in the distribution of wealth globally, regionally and nationally, coupled with the negative effects of higher levels of income disparities, should make us question current economic development approaches and examine the need to place equity at the center of the development agenda.<ref name=\\\"UNICEF2011\\\" />\\n\\nOstry, et al. (2014) reject the hypothesis that there is a major trade-off between a reduction of income inequality (through [[Redistribution (economics)|income redistribution]]) and economic growth. If that were the case, they hold, then redistribution that reduces income inequality would on average be bad for growth, taking into account both the direct effect of higher redistribution and the effect of the resulting lower inequality. Their research shows rather the opposite: increasing income inequality always has a significant and, in most cases, negative effect on economic growth while redistribution has an overall pro-growth effect (in one sample) or no growth effect. Their conclusion is that increasing inequality, particularly when inequality is already high, results in low growth, if any, and such growth may be unsustainable over long periods.\\n\\nPiketty and Saez (2014) note that there are important differences between income and wealth inequality dynamics. First, wealth concentration is always much higher than income concentration. The top 10 percent of wealth share typically falls in the 60 to 90 percent range of all wealth, whereas the top 10 percent income share is in the 30 to 50 percent range. The bottom 50 percent wealth share is always less than 5 percent, whereas the bottom 50 percent income share generally falls in the 20 to 30 percent range. The bottom half of the population hardly owns any wealth, but it does earn appreciable income:The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. On average, members of the bottom half of the population, in terms of wealth, own less than one-tenth of the average wealth. The inequality of labor income can be high, but it is usually much less extreme. Members of the bottom half of the population in income earn about half the average income. In sum, the concentration of capital ownership is always extreme, so that the very notion of capital is fairly abstract for large segments—if not the majority—of the population.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Inequality in the long run | journal=Science | year=2014 | volume=344 | issue=6186 | pages=838–43 | doi=10.1126/science.1251936}}<\\/ref> Piketty (2014) finds that wealth-income ratios, today, seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the \\\"classic patrimonial\\\" wealth-based societies of the 19th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living. He surmises that wealth accumulation is high because growth is low.<ref>{{cite book | title=Capital in the 21st century | publisher=Belknap Press | author=Piketty, Thomas | year=2014 | isbn=978-0674430006}}<\\/ref>\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{div col|cols=2}}\\n* [[Civil rights]]\\n* [[Digital divide]]\\n* [[Educational inequality]]\\n* [[Gini coefficient]]\\n* [[Global justice]]\\n* [[Health equity]]\\n* [[Horizontal inequality]]\\n* [[List of countries by income inequality]]\\n* [[List of countries by distribution of wealth]]\\n* [[LGBT social movements]]\\n* [[Social apartheid]]\\n* [[Social equality]]\\n* [[Social justice]]\\n* [[Social exclusion]]\\n* [[Social mobility]]\\n* [[Social stratification]]\\n* [[Structural violence]]\\n* [[Tax evasion]]\\n* [[Triple oppression]]\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|30em}}\\n\\n==Further reading==\\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = T | year = 2008 | title = Cultural capital and social inequality in health | url = | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 62 | issue = 7| page = e13 | doi=10.1136/jech.2007.066159}}\\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Acker | first1 = Joan | year = 1990 | title = Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: a theory of gendered organizations | url = | journal = [[Gender and Society]] | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 139–58 | doi=10.1177/089124390004002002}}\\n*Bourdieu, Pierre. 1996.''The State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power'', translated by Lauretta C.

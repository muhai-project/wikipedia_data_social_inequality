Social inequality refers to disparities in the distribution of economic assets and income as well as between the overall quality and luxury of each person's existence within a society, while economic inequality is caused by the unequal accumulation of [[wealth]]; social inequality exists because the lack of wealth in certain areas prohibits these people from obtaining the same housing, health care, etc. as the wealthy, in societies where access to these social goods depends on wealth.\\n\\nSocial inequality is linked to [[racial inequality]], [[gender inequality]], and [[wealth inequality]].<ref name=\\\"AP-20140127\\\">{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}<\\/ref> The way people behave socially, through racist or sexist practices and other forms of discrimination, tends to trickle down and affect the opportunities and wealth individuals can generate for themselves. [[Thomas Shapiro|Thomas M. Shapiro]] presents a hypothetical example of this in his book, ''The Hidden Cost of Being African American'', in which he tries to demonstrate the level of inequality on the \\\"playing field for blacks and whites\\\". One example he presents reports how a black family was denied a bank loan to use for housing, while a white family was approved. As being a homeowner is an important method in acquiring wealth, this situation created fewer opportunities for the black family to acquire wealth, producing social inequality.<ref>Shapiro, Thomas M. \\\"The Hidden Cost of Being African American.\\\" Oxford University Press 2004.<\\/ref><!--who are these families? Were there any other factors?-->\\n\\n== Forms ==\\nFollowing are the major types or forms of social inequality.\\n\\n===Gender inequality===\\n{{Main|Gender inequality}}\\nOne of the major forms of social inequality comes in the form of gender. Gender identity refers to persons’ internal “acceptance of sex, gender, or sexual categorizations as descriptive of themselves”<ref>Devor, 1997, xxiii<\\/ref> Among other ways, [[transgender]] and [[gender-variant]] persons can express their gender through their appearance, the statements they make, or official documents they present. In this context, gender normativity, which is understood as the social expectations placed on us when we present particular bodies,<ref>Stanley 2011<\\/ref> produces widespread cultural/institutional devaluations of trans identities, homosexuality and femininity.<ref>Schilt & Westbrook, 2009<\\/ref> Trans persons in particular have been defined as socially unproductive and disruptive.<ref>Irving, 2008<\\/ref>\\nThe emphasis on gender inequality is born out of the deepening division in the [[Gender role|roles]] assigned to men and women, particularly in the economic, political and educational spheres. Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes in most states in both the [[Global North]] and Global South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html |title=About us |publisher=Un.org |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}<\\/ref>\\nGender discrimination - especially concerning the status of women - has been a topic of serious discussion not only within academic and activist communities, but also by governmental agencies and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]]. These discussions seek to identify and remedy widespread, institutionalized barriers to access for women in their societies. By making use of [[gender analysis]], researchers try to understand the social expectations, responsibilities, resources and priorities of women and men within a specific context, examining the social, economic and environmental factors which influence their roles and decision-making capacity. By enforcing artificial separations between the social and economic roles of men and women, the lives of women and girls are negatively impacted, and this can have the effect of limiting social and economic development.<ref>{{cite book|last=Issac Kwaka Acheampong and Sidharta Sarkar|title=Gender, Poverty & Sustainable Livelihood|page=108}}<\\/ref>\\n\\nIt has been observed that global issues like [[HIV/AIDS]], illiteracy, and [[poverty]] are experienced far more often by women than by men;<ref>{{cite web|title=Empowering Women as Key Change Agents|url=http://www.thp.org/what_we_do/program_overview/empowering_women?gclid=CIPt9L6X6KsCFUJ76wodFhJUKw}}<\\/ref> in many countries, women and girls face problems such as access to education, which limits their opportunities to succeed, and further limits their ability to contribute economically to their society.<ref>{{cite web|title=Platform for Action|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/poverty.htm|work=United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women|accessdate=9 April 2013}}<\\/ref> Women are underrepresented in political activities and decision making processes throughout most of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meeting the Needs of the   World’s Women|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/daw/index.html}}<\\/ref> It is important to increase enrollment rates in school for girls and ensure they have safe, stable and good quality education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equal access to education|url=http://www.unicef.org/education/index_access.html}}<\\/ref> Women’s participation in work has been increasing globally, but women are faced with wage discrepancies and differences compared to what men earn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women, Poverty & Economics|url=http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/}}<\\/ref> This is true globally even in the agricultural and rural sector in developed as well as developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN: Gender discrimination accounts for 90% of wage gap between men and women|url=http://pressroom.ipc-undp.org/2011/un-gender-discrimination-accounts-for-90-of-wage-gap-between-men-and-women/}}<\\/ref> Structural impediments to women's ability to pursue and advance in their chosen professions often result in a phenomenon known as the [[glass ceiling]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Glass Ceiling Effect|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/papers/CotterHOV01.pdf}}<\\/ref> which refers to unseen - and often unacknowledged barriers that prevent minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements.

Unequal treatment and opportunities between racial groups is usually the result of some ethnic groups being considered superior to others.This inequality can manifest through discriminatory hiring practices on job sites; in some cases, employers have been shown to prefer hiring potential employees based on the perceived ethnicity of a candidate’s given name - even if all they have to go by in their decision are resumes featuring identical qualifications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rooth|first=Dan-Olof|title=Implicit Discrimination in Hiring: Real World Evidence|journal=IZA Discussion Paper|date=April 2007|page=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=984432}}<\\/ref> Part of these sorts of discriminatory practices stem from [[Stereotyping]] which is when people form assumptions about the tendencies and characteristics of certain social groups, often including ethnic groups, and typically rooted in assumptions about biology, cognitive capabilities, or even inherent, moral failings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dubow|first=Saul|title=Scientific Racism in Modern South Africa|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-47907-X|page=121}}<\\/ref> These negative attributions are then disseminated through a society through a number of different mediums, including television, newspapers and the internet, all of which play a role in promoting preconceived notions of race that disadvantage and marginalize groups of people.

For example, during the run-up to the 2012 federal elections in the United States, legislation in certain “[[battleground states]]”  that claimed to target voter fraud had the effect of disenfranchising tens of thousands of primarily African American voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=R.

The [[War on Drugs]] has been an important campaign in ensuring the constant incarceration of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized populations in North America. Over a million African Americans are incarcerated in the US, many of whom have been convicted of a drug possession charge. With the States of Colorado and Washington having legalized the possession of marijuana, drug reformists and anti-war on drugs lobbyists are hopeful that drug issues will be interpreted and dealt with from a healthcare perspective, instead of a matter of criminal law.\\n\\n===Caste inequality===\\nThe [[caste system]] is a type of social inequality that exists primarily among the Hindu religion in Indian subcontinent i.e. [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]] as well as in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].

It is also known as [[ageism]]: the stereotyping of and discrimination against individuals or groups based upon their age.  It is a set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, and values used to justify age-based prejudice, discrimination, and subordination.<ref>Kirkpatrick, George R.; Katsiaficas, George N.; Kirkpatrick, Robert George; Mary Lou Emery (1987). Introduction to critical sociology. Ardent Media. p. 261. ISBN 978-0-8290-1595-9. Retrieved 28 January 2011.<\\/ref> One form of ageism is adultism, which is the discrimination against children and people under the legal adult age.<ref>Lauter And Howe (1971) Conspiracy of the Young. Meridian Press.<\\/ref> An example of an act of adultism might be the policy of a certain establishment, restaurant, or place of business to not allow those under the legal adult age to enter their premises after a certain time or at all. While some people may benefit or enjoy these practices, some find them offensive and discriminatory.\\n\\nAs implied in the definitions above, treating people differently based upon their age is not necessarily discrimination.  Virtually every society has [[Age stratification|age-stratification]], meaning that there are different allocated social roles for people of different ages to perform.  Every society manages people’s aging by allocating certain roles for different age groups.  Age discrimination primarily occurs when age is used as an unfair criterion for allocating more or less rewarding roles and resources.  Scholars of age inequality have suggested that certain social organizations favor particular age inequalities. For instance, because of their emphasis on training and maintaining productive citizens, modern capitalist societies may dedicate disproportionate resources to training the young and maintaining the middle-aged worker to the detriment of the elderly and the retired (especially those already disadvantaged by income/wealth inequality).<ref>Foner p.1116<\\/ref>\\n\\nIn modern, technologically advanced societies, there is a tendency for both the young and the old to be relatively disadvantaged.  However, more recently, in the United States the tendency is for the young to be most disadvantaged.  For example, Foner reports with regard to the US, “poverty levels in the first decade of the 21st Century were only slightly higher among people aged 65 and older than for people in the middle years, whereas children under 18 had the highest levels of poverty.” One possible reason for this may be that whereas the elderly have had the opportunity to build their wealth throughout their lives, younger people have the disadvantage of recently entering into or having not yet entered into the economic sphere.<ref>Ibid.<\\/ref>\\n\\nAlthough this does not exhaust the scope of age discrimination, in modern societies it is often discussed primarily with regards to the work environment.  Indeed, nonparticipation in the labor force and the unequal access to rewarding jobs means that the elderly and the young are often subject to unfair disadvantages because of their age.  On the one hand, the elderly are less likely to be involved in the workforce: “in 2003, less than 20% of people aged 65 and older in the United States were in the labor force....”<ref>Ibid.<\\/ref> At the same time, old age may or may not put one at a disadvantage in accessing positions of prestige.  Old age may benefit one in such positions, but it may also disadvantage one because of negative ageist stereotypes of old people.  On the other hand, young people are often disadvantaged from accessing prestigious or relatively rewarding jobs, because of their recent entry to the work force or because they are still completing their education.  Typically, once they enter the labor force or take a part-time job while in school, they start at entry level positions with low level wages.  Furthermore, because of their lack of prior work experience, they can also often be forced to take marginal jobs, where they can be taken advantage of by their employers.\\n\\n===Class inequality===\\n{{main|Social class}}\\n[[Image:Going up or down advertisement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Illustration from a 1916 advertisement for a vocational school in the back of a US magazine.  This advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of social mobility, as well as threatening the consequences of ending up in the [[underclass]] in the great [[income inequality]] existing during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ]]\\n\\nThe measure of inequality between social classes depends on the definition used. For [[Karl Marx]], two major social classes with significant inequalities existed: the working class ([[proletariat]]) and the capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]). This simple division represents opposing social interests of its members, capital gain for the capitalists and survival for the laborers, creating inequality and [[social conflict]]. Marx associates oppression and exploitation with it. [[Max Weber]], on the other hand, uses social classes as a stratification tool based on wealth and status. For him social class is strongly associated with prestige and privileges. It may explain social reproduction, the tendency of social classes to remain stable across generations maintaining most of their inequalities as well. Such inequalities include differences in income, wealth, access to education, pension levels, social status, socio-economic safety-net.<ref>Stiglitz, Joseph. 2012. The Price of Inequality.

In [[industrialized nations]], health inequalities are most prevalent in countries that have not implemented a [[universal health care]] system, such as the United States.

In Canada, for example, equity in the availability of health services has been improved dramatically through [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. People don’t have to worry about how they will pay health care, or rely on emergency rooms for care, since health care is provided for the entire population. However, inequality issues still remain. For example, not everyone has the same level of access to services.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Karen R.|title=Health and Health Care in Essentials of Contemporary Sociology|year=1994|publisher=Copp Clark Longman|location=Toronto|page=275}}<\\/ref> Inequalities in health are not, however, only related to access to health care. Even if everyone had the same level of access, inequalities may still remain. This is because health status is a product of more than just how much medical care people have available to them. While Medicare has equalized access to health care by removing the need for direct payments at the time of services, which improved the health of low status people, inequities in health are still prevalent in Canada<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=K.R.|title=The Inverse Care Law in Canada: Differential Access Under Universal Free Health Insurance|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=Toronto|pages=118–134}}<\\/ref> This may be due to the state of the current social system, which bear other types of inequalities such as economic, racial and gender inequality.\\n\\nA lack of health equity is also evident in the developing world, where the importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Health inequalities can vary greatly depending on the country one is looking at. Inequalities in health are often associated with socioeconomic status and access to health care. Health inequities can occur when the distribution of public health services is unequal. For example, in Indonesia in 1990, only 12% of government spending for health was for services consumed by the poorest 20% of households, while the wealthiest 20% consumed 29% of the government subsidy in the health sector.<ref>{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=World Development Report|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}<\\/ref> Access to health care is heavily influenced by socioeconomic status as well, as wealthier population groups have a higher probability of obtaining care when they need it. A study by Makinen et al. (2000) found that in the majority of developing countries they looked at, there was an upward trend by [[Quantile|quintile]] in health care use for those reporting illness. Wealthier groups are also more likely to be seen by doctors and to receive medicine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mankinen et al|title=Inequalities in Health Care Use and Expenditures: Empirical Data from Eight Developing Countries and Countries in Transition|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000000100006&script=sci_arttext&tlng=pt}}<\\/ref>\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{div col|cols=2}}\\n* [[Civil rights]]\\n* [[Digital divide]]\\n* [[Educational inequality]]\\n* [[Gini coefficient]]\\n* [[Global justice|Global inequality]]\\n* [[Health equity]]\\n* [[Horizontal inequality]]\\n* [[LGBT social movements]]\\n* [[Social equality]], opposite of ''social inequality''\\n* [[Social justice]]\\n* [[Social exclusion]]\\n* [[Social mobility]]\\n* [[Social stratification]]\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Ibid|date=April 2013}}\\n{{reflist|30em}}\\n\\n==Further reading==\\n*Abel, T. 2008. \\\"Cultural capital and social inequality in health.\\\" ''[[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]]'' 62(7): e13.\\n*Acker, Joan. 1990. “Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: a theory of gendered organizations.” ''[[Gender and Society]]'' 4:139-58\\n*Arts, W. and J.

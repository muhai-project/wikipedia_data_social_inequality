[[Karl Marx]] thought \\\"class\\\" was defined by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]] is the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the [[means of production]].

For example, permitted mode of dress in some times and places was strictly regulated, with sumptuous dressing only for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]], whereas [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewelry appropriate for a person's social rank and [[social status|station]]. In Europe, these laws became increasingly commonplace during the Middle Ages. However, these laws were prone to change due to societal changes, and in many cases, these distinctions may either almost disappear, such as the distinction between a patrician and a plebeian being almost erased during the late [[Roman Republic]].\\n\\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had a large influence over political ideals of the [[French Revolution]] because of his views of inequality and classes. Rousseau saw humans as \\\"naturally pure and good,\\\" meaning that humans from birth were seen as innocent and any evilness was learned. He believed that social problems arise through the development of society and suppressing the innate pureness of humankind. He also believed that [[private property]] is the main reason for social issues in society because private property creates inequality through the property's value. Even though his theory predicted if there were no private property then there would be wide spread equality, Rousseau accepted that there will always be social inequality because of how society is viewed and run.<ref name=\\\"Conley, Dalton 2017\\\">{{cite book|author=Conley, Dalton|chapter=Stratification|editor=Bakeman, Karl|title=You May Ask Yourself, 5th Edition|publisher=W.W.

They also acknowledged that private property will ultimately cause inequality because specific resources that are privately owned can be stored and the owners profit off of the deficit of the resource. This can create competition between the classes that was seen as necessary by these thinkers.<ref name=\\\"Conley, Dalton 2017\\\"/> This also creates [[Social stratification|stratification]] between the classes keeping a distinct difference between lower, poorer classes and the higher, wealthier classes.\\n\\n==Theoretical models==\\nDefinitions of social classes reflect a number of [[social theory|sociological perspectives]], informed by [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

Objectively, a class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]]. Subjectively, the members will necessarily have some perception (\\\"[[class consciousness]]\\\") of their similarity and common interest. Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest but is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically. These class relations are reproduced through time.\\n\\nIn [[Marxist theory]], the [[class structure]] of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is characterized by the conflict between two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the [[means of production]] and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or \\\"working class\\\") who must sell their own labour power ([[wage labour]]). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property, a state of inequality that is normalized and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]].\\n\\nFor Marxists, every person in the process of production has separate social relationships and issues. Along with this, every person is placed into different groups that have similar interests and values that can differ drastically from group to group. Class is special in that does not relate to specifically to a singular person, but to a specific role.<ref name=\\\"Conley, Dalton 2017\\\"/>\\n\\nMarxists explain the history of \\\"civilized\\\" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the bourgeoisie.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \\\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231.<\\/ref>\\n\\nFurthermore, \\\"in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed\\\".<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \\\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231<\\/ref> \\\"An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers) and sergeants (foremen, over-lookers) who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist\\\".<ref>Karl Marx. ''Capital: An Analysis of Capitalist Production'', Volume 1; Moscow; 1959; p. 332.<\\/ref>\\n\\nMarx makes the argument that, as the bourgeoisie reach a point of wealth accumulation, they hold enough power as the dominant class to shape political institutions and society according to their own interests. Marx then goes on to claim that the non-elite class, owing to their large numbers, have the power to overthrow the elite and create an equal society.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Manifesto of the Communist Party|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}<\\/ref>\\n\\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: \\\"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\\\". This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for financial and banking institutions and money.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. \\\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\\", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 232-234.<\\/ref><ref>Karl Marx ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' (1875)<\\/ref>\\n\\nThese theorists have taken this binary class system and expanded it to include contradictory class locations, the idea that a person can be employed in many different class locations that fall between the two classes of proletariat and bourgeoisie. [[Erik Olin Wright]] stated that class definitions are more diverse and elaborate through identifying with multiple classes, having familial ties with people in different a class, or having a temporary leadership role.<ref name=\\\"Conley, Dalton 2017\\\"/>\\n\\n===Weberian===\\n{{main|Three-component theory of stratification}}\\n[[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that saw social class as emerging from an interplay between \\\"class\\\", \\\"status\\\" and \\\"power\\\". Weber believed that class position was determined by a person's relationship to the means of production, while status or \\\"Stand\\\" emerged from estimations of honor or prestige.<ref>Weber, Max (2015/1921).  \\\"Classes, Stände, Parties\\\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–57.<\\/ref>\\n\\nWeber views class as a group of people who have common goals and opportunities that are available to them. This means that what separates each class from each other is their value in the marketplace through their own goods and services. This creates a divide between the classes through the assets that they have such as property and expertise.<ref name=\\\"Conley, Dalton 2017\\\"/>\\n\\nWeber derived many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of many countries. He noted that contrary to Marx's theories, stratification was based on more than simply ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber pointed out that some members of the aristocracy lack economic wealth yet might nevertheless have political power. Likewise in Europe, many wealthy Jewish families lacked prestige and honor because they were considered members of a \\\"pariah group\\\".\\n* Class: A person's economic position in a society. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own.\\n* Status: A person's prestige, social honor or popularity in a society. Weber noted that political power was not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's status. Poets and saints, for example, can possess immense influence on society with often little economic worth.\\n* Power: A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status, but they still hold immense power.\\n\\n===Great British Class Survey===\\n{{Main|Great British Class Survey}}\\nOn 2 April 2013, the results of a survey<ref name=\\\"BBC Lab UK Survey\\\">{{cite web|url=https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/the-great-british-class-survey|title=Britain's Real Class System: Great British Class Survey|publisher=BBC Lab UK|url-status= |accessdate=4 April 2013}}<\\/ref> conducted by [[BBC Lab UK]] developed in collaboration with academic experts and slated to be published in the journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'' were published online.<ref name=Sociology4213>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Mike|last2=Devine |first2=Fiona |last3=Cunningham |first3=Niall |last4=Taylor |first4=Mark |last5=Li |first5=Yaojun |author6=Johs.

Many aristocratic peerages or titles have seats attached to them, with the holder of the title (e.g. Earl of Bristol) and his family being the custodians of the house, but not the owners. Many of these require high expenditures, so wealth is typically needed. Many aristocratic peerages and their homes are parts of estates, owned and run by the title holder with moneys generated by the land, rents or other sources of wealth. However, in the United States where there is no aristocracy or royalty, the upper class status belongs to the extremely wealthy, the so-called \\\"super-rich\\\", though there is some tendency even in the United States for those with old family wealth to look down on those who have earned their money in business, the struggle between [[nouveau riche|new money]] and [[old money]].\\n\\nThe upper class is the group of people located at the top of the socioeconomic chart. They are the highest you can be.

Areas of potential social inequality include [[voting rights]],  [[freedom of speech]] and assembly, the extent of [[property rights]] and access to [[education]], [[health care]] and other social goods.\\n\\nInequality is socially created by matching two different kinds of processes.  “The social roles in society are first matched to ‘reward packages’ of unequal value, and individual members of society are then allocated to the positions so defined and rewarded” <ref>Grusky, David B.  2001. “The Past, Present and Future of Social Inequality.”  Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender. Second Edition. Colorado: Westview Press.<\\/ref>\\n\\nSocial inequality is different from [[economic inequality]] but the two inequalities are linked.  Economic inequality refers to disparities in the distribution of economic assets and income.  While economic inequality is caused by the unequal distribution of [[wealth]], social inequality exists because the lack of wealth in certain areas prohibits these people from obtaining the same housing, health care, etc. as the wealthy in societies where access to these social goods depends on wealth.  “The degree of inequality in a given reward or asset depends, of course, on its dispersion or concentration across the individuals in the population” <ref>Grusky, David B.  2001. “The Past, Present and Future of Social Inequality.”  Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender.

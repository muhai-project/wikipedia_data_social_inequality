Areas of potential social inequality include [[voting rights]],  [[freedom of speech]] and assembly, the extent of [[property rights]] and access to [[education]], [[health care]], quality [[Housing inequality|housing]] and other social goods.\\n\\n==Causes==\\nSocial inequality is different from [[economic inequality]], though the two are linked.  Economic inequality refers to disparities in the distribution of economic assets and income.  While economic inequality is caused by the unequal accumulation of [[wealth]], social inequality exists because the lack of wealth in certain areas prohibits these people from obtaining the same housing, health care, etc. as the wealthy, in societies where access to these social goods depends on wealth.\\n\\nSocial inequality is linked to [[racial inequality]] and [[wealth inequality]].  The way people behave socially, through racism and other forms of discrimination, tends to trickle down and affect the opportunities and wealth individuals can generate for themselves. Thomas M. Shapiro presents a hypothetical example of this in his book, ''The Hidden Cost of Being African American'', in which he tries to demonstrate the level of inequality on the \\\"playing field for blacks and whites\\\". One example he presents reports how a black family was denied a bank loan to use for housing, while a white family was approved. As being a homeowner is an important method in acquiring wealth, this situation created fewer opportunities for the black family to acquire wealth, producing social inequality.<ref>Shapiro, Thomas M. \\\"The Hidden Cost of Being African American.\\\" Oxford University Press 2004.<\\/ref><!--who are these families?
